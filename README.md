We are part of the [nBio Biomedical Neuroengineering research group](http://nbio.umh.es) of the [Miguel Hernández University of Elche](https://www.umh.es), and we are focused on the use of technology to improve the quality of life. Investigating and developing applications that are useful for people, and that have the potential to be transferred to society, is in our DNA.

The medical robotics group is a muldisciplinary team dedicated to the development of robotic technology in the field of health and surgery. Experts in the development of wearable electronics for monitoring biometric parameters and in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for early diagnosis of pathologies and / or the improvement of quality of life of users. In the field of robotic surgery we work on the development of new intra-operative medical imaging systems, based on RF and US, for application to imaging-guided robotic surgery.
